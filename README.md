The game we designed has a green square block as a protagonist which jumps
as we give command, game will be over when the green block lands on black blocks or
collides head-on with a white block. To start the game we have click on the Green start
button and to stop we will be clicking Red stop button. We will click on
“spacebar” or “up arrow” button to make the green block jump. 
Get a score of 15 to win.
This game is inspired from a game by user @theangryepicbanana of replit.com and re engineered by us.
